# **2420- Assignment-3 part 1**
## Automating System Information with Bash and Nginx

## **Introduction**

The purpose of this assignment is to write a Bash script that will generate an index.html file and configure it to run daily at 5:00 using a systemd system and timer. The HTML document generated by this script will be Hosted on a Nginx web server running on your Arch Linux droplet, with a ufw firewall configured to enhance server security

1. **Task 1:** Setting up a system user with directories
2. **Task 2:** Creating and configuring systemd service and scripts
3. **Task 3:** Configuring Nginx
4. **Task 4:** Installing and configuring ufw for ssh and HTTP
5. **Task 5:** Verifying that the System Information page is working properly


## **Task One:** Setting up user and directories

> What is the benefit of creating a system user for this task?


The reason we want to create a system user instead of using a regular user or root is to enhance security and keep thefunctions isolated from regular user activities. It decreases the risk of accidental or malicious system wide chages.


**Step 1:** Creating a new user

Type the following command:

```
sudo useradd -r -d /var/lib/webgen -s /usr/sbin/nologin webgen
```
**Explanation:**
- `-r`: This will create a system account
- `-d`: This specifies the home directory
- `-s /usr/sbin/nologin`:  This specifies the non-login shell
  

**Step 2:** Create home directory

Next, since we don't have a home directory yet, we want to create one using this command

```
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/webgen
```


**Step 3:** Create subdirectory /bin

This command is used to create subdirectories within the webgen directory

```
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/webgen/bin
```


**Step 4:** Create subdirectory /HTML

This command is used to create subdirectories within the webgen directory

```
sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/webgen/HTML
```


**Step 5:** Cloning the generated index script

Our next step is setting up the generated index script.
This can be done by cloning it from the sourcehut repository with this command:

```
git clone https://git.sr.ht/~nathan_climbs/2420-as2-start
```


**Step 6:** Moving the generated script into the correct directory

Since we cloned the generated script into the home directory, we want to move it into the appropriate /var/lib/webgen/bin/ directory using:

```
sudo mv 2420-as2-start/generate_index /var/lib/webgen/bin/
```


**Step 7:** Give executable permissions to script

```
sudo chmod +x /var/lib/webgen/bin/generate_index
```



**Step 8:** Set Ownership

```
sudo chown -R webgen:webgen /var/lib/webgen
```


## **Task Two:** Creating and configuring systemd service and scripts
